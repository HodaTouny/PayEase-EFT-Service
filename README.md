## Description

PayEase is a comprehensive financial platform designed to simplify money transfers and streamline bill payments.

PayEase supports various wallet providers, including telecommunication companies, banks, and electronic payment firms.

## Requirements

### User

1. **Signup Process:**
   - Users can register in two ways:
     - Register using their bank account and the registered mobile number on the bank. The app verifies the information through the bank API.
     - Register using their mobile number with a wallet provided by a wallet provider (e.g., Vodafone Cash, CIB). The mobile number is verified with the wallet provider. After verification, the user must enter a unique username and a complex password.
   - For both registration methods, the system verifies that the user owns the mobile number by sending an OTP and confirming it.

2. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can sign in to the system using their PayEase username and password.
   - Upon logging in, the user profile is loaded based on their registration type.

3. **Transaction Options:**
   - Both types of users (bank account and wallet) have the following options:
     - Transfer to a wallet using the recipient's mobile number.
     - Transfer to another PayEase account.
     - Inquire about their account balance.
     - Pay bills.

4. **Bank Account Specifics:**
   - Transferring to a bank account is only valid for users registered using their bank account.

5. **Utility Bill Payment:**
   - Utility bill payment involves creating and deducting the bill amount from the userâ€™s account.
   - The system supports the creation and payment of three bill types: Gas, Electricity, and Water.
   - Bill contents vary based on the bill types, and assumptions about bill details should be made.
